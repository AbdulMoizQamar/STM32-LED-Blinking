# STM32STM32F103C8T6-LED-Blinking
This project showcases a simple LED blinking application using the STM32 microcontroller. Written in C, it employs the STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library to toggle an LED connected to pin PC13 at regular intervals, serving as an introduction to GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) operations on STM32 devices.
